<h1>Ethical Advertisement Blocking</h1>
<h1>Peyton McGill</h1>
<h2>How it started</h2>
<div>One of the first advertisements to appear online was purchased by AT&T on the website Hotwire. 
    The ad appeared as a banner that displayed the phrase 
    “Have you ever clicked your mouse right HERE? YOU WILL” even today we can see the influence of such click baiting tactics. 
    The eye catching colors and the call to action phrase.
    This ad had a click through percentage of forty four (meaning 44% of people who saw the ad clicked it, a number that no modern advertisement will ever see). 
    The high amount of interaction with this advertisement had to do with it being a new concept for internet users. 
    As online marketing has continued to develop, a distrust soon emerged between those who use the internet and the ads being presented. 
    Being told you were the 100,000 visitor to a website who had won some new iPod became a common occurrence. 
    Having to fill out a survey or enter your email to view a webpage were seen as things users would just have ot learn to deal with. 
    Howerver we can see that isn't the case today with most popular sites regulating what advertisements show up.

<h2>State of online advertising today</h2>
<div>Over 260 billion dollars were spent on advertising on the internet last year. This massive amount of spending allows many websites to provide their services for free by running off only advertisements. Advertising has expanded beyond the humble beginning of just a banner at the top of a webpage with a large portion going to both search tools and video playback. Individuals browsing the internet today are much less likely to click on blatant advertisements as before so there is more value in having an ad appear as a search result for certain keywords (like google does) or to put the advertisement before the content such as a video. 
</div>
<h2>How and why people block ads</h2>
<div>The majority of advertisement blocking is done by browser extensions that filter known advertising content. The most popular ones being Adblock, Adblock Plus, and uBlock Origin. Some browsers even have this content filtering built in such as Brave and even browsers like Internet Explorer and Chrome have built in content filtering for things like pop ups (ads that attempt to open a new window without user permission). VPNs (virtual private networks) often have advertisement filtering built in. 
    With so many people opting out of receiving these ads it brings up why do people hate online advertisements. While the answer can be as simple as they find it annoying it helps to look into the history of these ads are we previously touched on. While radio and television advertisements must be approved before they are put on the air the inherent decentralization of the internet allows many sites to host ads that hinder the ability for someone to use said site, pose a security risk for the user, or even show explicit content to the user. While influential tech companies like Google have been able to curb some of this behavior, they do not control the entire internet so many users see content filtering extensions as necessary. 
</div>
<h2>The anti-adblock arms race</h2>
<div>Many websites have changed the way advertisements work on their websites to counter how ad blocking software removes the content. This may just be something as simple as a banner asking the user to please disable the blocker or sometimes even link a donation page, or it can prevent the webpage being shown until the extension is disabled. Sometimes the advertisements become embedded with the content, a video stream may include a paid promotion or websites will change elements of itself to act as marketing for some product. 
</div>
<h2>Adblock Plus controversy</h2>
<div>ABP (adblock plus) is currently the most popular one of these extensions with over 10 million users on both Firefox and Chrome. They also provide a mobile app for Android and IOS devices. The software has come under criticism from both users and advertisers for its introduction of a whitelist. The whitelist refers to sites on which the extension by default (the whitelist can be edited and disabled by users) will not block advertising content. Some users were upset with this change as being another announce, however advertisers compared this whitelist to a form of extortion by ABP. These claims arose because not only does a site have to follow the guidelines ABP provides for acceptable advertisements and pay a fee to then be added to the whitelist. ABP has responded to these critics by explaining how these standards benefits all users of the web (even those not using ABP) and the fee required to get onto the whitelist helps pay for the continued development of the extension and monitoring websites to make sure they continue to comply with said standards.
</div>
<h2>Is it ethical to use ad blocking extensions?</h2>
<div>Personally I do use ad blocking extensions in any browser I download. Using this software to filter content that can cause security risks for my computer or personal information is a justification that I believe most can agree with. However sites that host advertisements that do not pose such risks should be whitelisted by the user. These sites typically do not cost the user anything to access so can only be sustained through these advertisements. In such scenarios there is an obligation to not filter the advertisements. 
</div>
<h2>What are possible solutions</h2>
<div>A possible way to reduce ad blocking is by making ads online less intrusive than they currently are. This appears to be the goal of ABP’s acceptable advertisement program as they give critrium to certain types of ads about how they can display their message. This can include things from what types of colors are chosen to how much screen space they take up. One standard that appears on most mainstream websites is having ads clearly labeled so users don’t mistake them from the website’s content. We can consider that a guiding principle for designing advertisements and then come up with new ones that treat the user in an ethical manner. Advertisements should not mislead (you are the winner), they should be primarily passive (not require users to input commands or information), and be appropriate for the content being hosted on the website (no alcohol ads on a site that children use). These are just some ideas that can be expanded upon and possibly added to such movements to create advertising standards.</div>
